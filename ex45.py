# Here are your requirements:

#    Make a different game.
#    Use more than one file, and use import to use them. Make sure you know what that is.
#    Use one class per room and give the classes names that fit their purpose (like GoldRoom, KoiPondRoom).
#    Your runner will need to know about these rooms, so make a class that runs them and knows about them.
#    There's plenty of ways to do this, but consider having each room return what room is next or setting a variable of what room is next.
#
#    Finally, get it running with a web application framework such as Django or Flask.
